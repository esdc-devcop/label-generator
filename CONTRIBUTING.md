# How to contribute
From all the developers currently working on this project, we are so happy your willing to help! We need it!

This project is all about making it easier for projects to start using GCCode. Any labels that might help a team get started can be added.

## Getting involved
If you're new to GCCode or Git don't worry, open an issue asking for some help and what you want to do. We'll be happy to help.

### Reporting
Reporting new additions though labels is key. We need to keep track of what is needed and wanted in terms of features and labels.

If you are submitting new label ideas be sure to use the `new-label` issue template.

If you are reporting lots of good issues, you can request "reporter" access so you can tag your own issues.

### Developing

#### New Developers
You can fork the project, and make a merge request with your changes.

After your first approved merge request, you can request "developer" access. We'll take a quick look at your previous contributions and probably contact you personally before approving.
